# Pas-Sword.

## Acknowledgements / Legally stuff

The sword presented here is derived from [this sword](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:607385/#files) which was released under the Creative Commons. Thanks to the user *Americanlasercutter* for doing the gritty work of designing a thoroughly gorgeous sword.

The Tengwar typeface was downloaded from [here](http://www.fontspace.com/harri-per%C3%A4l%C3%A4/tengwar-cursive). Apparently the license is unknown, so I've not included it in the repo.

Overall, I try to release all designs under the [Peer Production License](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License) which is pretty good for independent workers and workers' collectives. If there's conflicts with the original CC or the typeface's license I'll modify the designs so they're legally inoffensive.
