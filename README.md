# lasercutting
Repo for my personal lasercut designs. They're structured based on project. I usually save a version with all text converted to paths for use on other machines which don't have the typefaces that I want. I will give credits and sources for icons used from elsewhere, although I do try to avoid using non-free things.

## License
Everything here is released under the [Peer Production License](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License). This license is a Copyfarleft license designed to allow independent workers and workers' collectives to freely release, produce, and use others' work for commercial gain free of charge **but prevents non-independent workers or workers' collectives from using the work for profit** ie. private corporations or businesses. This makes it a valuable tool for retaining control over our work whilst allowing others to share it. I encourage others to do the same.
